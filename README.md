# Sales-Data-live-Prediction-using-ARIMA-in-Machine-Learning
 Machine Learning Time Series Analysis on Sales Data
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project applies time series forecasting techniques combined with machine learning models to predict future sales based on historical data.
The goal is to provide data-driven insights that can help businesses with demand planning, inventory management, and revenue optimization.

# Business Problem
Sales forecasting is critical for:

Anticipating demand surges and drops.

Optimizing stock levels to reduce costs.

Improving supply chain efficiency and customer satisfaction.

Traditional statistical models like ARIMA capture trends and seasonality, while machine learning models can incorporate more complex patterns and external factors.

# Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python 3.x

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, XGBoost, statsmodels, Prophet

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

# Methodology
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handle missing values and outliers.

Convert date columns to datetime format.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identify trends, seasonal patterns, and anomalies.

Visualize sales fluctuations over time.

Feature Engineering

Generate time-based features (month, quarter, day-of-week).

Include lag features and rolling averages.

Modeling

Compare multiple models: ARIMA, Prophet, Random Forest, XGBoost.

Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.

Evaluation

Use RMSE, MAE, and MAPE to measure forecast accuracy.

Visualization & Interpretation

Plot actual vs. predicted sales.

Highlight confidence intervals for forecasts.
